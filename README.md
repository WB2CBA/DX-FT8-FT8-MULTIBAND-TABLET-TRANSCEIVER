DX FT8 TRANSCEIVER PROJECT is a collaboration between Charles(Charley)Hill, W5BAA and Barbaros(Barb)Asuroglu, WB2CBA.

DX FT8 Project is brain child of Charles(Charley)Hill, W5BAA. Charley designed and build various versions of GUI based FT8 Transceivers over the years. 

I was lucky enough to collaborate with Charley on 3 different versions of GUI FT8 Transceiver.

DX FT8 is the culmination of all that experience we gained from previous versions.

I can't thank enough Charley for his excellent GUI FT8 Firmware and his perseverance to create a standalone FT8 TABLET Transceiver.

It's a pleasure for me to collaborate with Charley,W5BAA, on hardware side, RF design and PCB design of DX FT8 Transceiver.

DX FT8 is an OPEN SOURCE PROJECT.
---------------------------------
DX FT8 is a FT8 Digital mode capable HF QRPp GUI (Graphical User Interface) based multiband Transceiver.

DX FT8 is abreviation for Digital Xceiver for FT8. 

Main aim of DX FT8 Transceiver Project is to create a highly portable stand-alone FT8 GUI Transceiver. Stand-alone aim is to create a user interface for working FT8 digital mode plus Multiband transceiver packed into one unit. 

This creates an advantage for carrying one GUI based FT8 operation capable Transceiver unit and no longer needs to carry a PC or a laptop or tablet for GUI interface operation for FT8 with a classic transceiver. 

This approach is quite appealing for smaller and lighter setups for backpacking for SOTA or POTA activations or as a travel transceiver with FT8.  

Here are some highlights on DX FT8 Specifications:

-	DX FT8 Transceiver GUI (Graphical User Interface) and processing power comes from ST Micro STM32F746 DISCO Evaluation board. This is a ARM CORTEX based evaluation board for STM32F746 microcontrollers with below outlined specifications: 

-	STM32F746NGH6 Arm® Cortex® core-based microcontroller with 1 Mbyte of Flash memory and 340 Kbytes of RAM, in BGA216 package 

-	4.3 inch RGB 480×272 color LCD-TFT with capacitive touch screen 

-	128-Mbit Quad-SPI Flash memory
 
-	DX FT8 Transceiver RF Board plugs into STM32F746 DISCO evaluation board to form the DX FT8 transceiver. 

-	DX FT8 Transceiver operates on 5 HF bands or 7 Bands depending on PCB type. Design files for both 5 band and 7 bands boards are posted in this github page.

-	These bands are:

For 5 Bands Board:
  
1 – 20m (14.074 MHz)

2- 17m (18.100 MHz)

3- 15m (21.074 MHz)

4- 12m (24.915 MHz)

5- 10m (28.074 MHz)

For 7 Bands Board:
  
1 – 40m (7.074 MHz)

2- 30m (10.136 MHz)

3 – 20m (14.074 MHz)

4- 17m (18.100 MHz)

5- 15m (21.074 MHz)

6- 12m (24.915 MHz)

7- 10m (28.074 MHz)


DX FT8 Transceiver has two RF Power Output Selection, LOW RF POWER and HIGH RF POWER which can be selected with the RF POWER Slide switch on the side of the transceiver.

40m	   372mW	       844mW

30m	   373mW	       843mW

20m	   380mW	       823mW

17m	   354mW	       762mW

15m	   314mW	       654mW

12m	   259mW	       520mW

10m	   231mW	       445mW

-	DX FT8 Transceiver can operate either from 5V USB power bank or any 1000mA capacity USB power source or by using the DC barrel Connector can be powered from 7V to 15V external power supply. A power supply source can be selected with DC POWER SELECT slide switch located on the side of the Transceiver. 

-	DX FT8 TRANSCEIVER uses an unconventional RF power Amplifier consisting of a TTL octal buffer IC and step up RF Transformer. There is no conventional MOSFET PA transistors. This creates an extremely resilient RF PA for failure due to high SWR or no antenna accidental operations.  This is an advantage for portable operations as antenna conditions can vary.

-	DX FT8 TRANSCEIVER incorporates a TAYLOE detector based Qudarature Sampling detector receiver with a high gain RF Preamplifier which outputs an I and Q phase output to STM32F746 DISCO board which generates true Upper Side Band (USB) SSB receive signal.

DX FT8 FIRMWARE UPDATE HISTORY:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DX FT8 Project Firmware Version 1.9.7 Release Notes: 09 June 2025
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V1.9.7 brings improvements and fixes for some DX FT8 rigs with poor reception quality.
 
 Further on air testing has revealed a flaw with the changes made to allow for repeat RR73 
messages in V1.9.5.

In the case of being in the Beacon Mode and a Repeat RR73 message is sent, the RSL from 

the Target Station is logged as zero instead of the value sent from the Target Station.

Now, in version V1.9.5 the RSL from the Target Station is logged properly.

This release introduces a new configuration file format based on the .INI file format. 

Release Source Code Files are under DX FT8 FIRMWARE SOURCE CODE FILES Directory. 

The existing ‘StationData.txt’ format continues to be supported however the new format is 
recommended because it is much more tolerant of formatting errors. 

It should be named ‘StationData.ini’ placed in the root directory of the SDCard. 

Delete the StationData.txt file to use the ‘StationData.ini’ file. 

All new features will be enabled using StationData.ini file. 

StationData.txt is now deprecated. 

Leading and trailing spaces and comment lines are permitted. Comment lines start with ‘;’ or ‘#’.

 [Station] 

Call=G8KIG 

Locator=IO91 

[FreeText] 

1=Free text 1 

2=Free text 2 

[BandData] 
40=7.174 

30=10.136 

20=14.174 

17=18.201 

15=21.174 

12=24.925 

10=28.174 

There are three sections in the file; ‘Station’, ‘FreeText’ and ‘BandData’. 

Only the first section ‘Station’ is required. 

The Call and Locator is configured in this Station section. 

In the ‘FreeText’ section, up to two free text messages can be configured. 

The final section ‘BandData’ introduces a new feature:

 The frequency used by the transceiver for each band can be modified. 

The 40M and 20M frequencies only apply to the 7-band transceiver.

 e.g. the Japan domestic FT8 frequency on 40m is 7.041Mhz, so the ‘BandData’ section to 
configure this would be
 
 [BandData] 
40=7.041 

Bug fixes:
 
 From Charley W5BAA:
 
 •FT8 transmissions were being sent anything up to 1.0 seconds before other 
implementations, transmissions are now being sent around 0.2 seconds into the time 
slot.

 •When an FT8 contact is made in Beacon Mode the contact is now not logged until either 
a 73 or RR73 message is received from the target station
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The Audio DSP Algorithms have been modified to improve Unwanted Side Band Suppression.

- The Firmware is now being provided as a HEX File to make installation via ST Link easier.

Please note that for Users with Five Band Boards or Seven Band Boards that it is highly recommended that you use a 

Freshly Formatted SD Card with a Fresh StationData.txt file before using DX FT8 V1.9 for the first time.

- An Abstract outlining DX FT8 Conception and Design path as a PDF file added.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: We would like to thank Paul Winwood, G8KIG, for his contributions to refine and refactor DX FT8 Firmware as well

  as adding new features and cleaning the code. Paul's contributions are reflected in DX FT8 firmware.
